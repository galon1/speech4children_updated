      "We were lucky to get in when my son turned three. As soon as we started seeing Amit, we knew we were in safe hands. Amit is a game changer in the field of autism and communication disorders related therapies, leaving a blazing trail behind her. With Amit’s fierce dedication to our son, we know exactly what are the challenges he faces, and how to support him. She is very knowledgeable, ever adapting to my son’s needs and preferred activities, is able to teach him what all others could not. Dedication, accuracy, professionalism, humor, immense energy, all describe Amit but don’t do enough justice to describe how important her work is with our son and us. We are forever grateful for her presence. ",

      "I initially discovered Amit Alon, as a young, overwhelmed, and anxious young mother. My son had been recently diagnosed with autism, with limited expressive communication. While dealing with the challenges of young motherhood, now compounded with the task of raising a child with special needs, I was defeated. After beginning speech and language services with Amit, I began to notice a substantial change in my child. Not only did she quickly establish and maintain a warm rapport with him, her methodology and expertise have served as a great anchor to my family. During his tenure with Amit, my has evolved from using a PECS communication system, to him currently speaking in complex sentences, effectively expressing his needs, and learning how to appreciate the perspectives of others. SLP goals, IEP goals, and life skills in tandem. Amit Alon has not only been an asset to my family, she serves as an unbiased sounding board on critical decisions, whose opinion I highly value. Amit Alon is the epitome of professionalism, whom it would be my pleasure to recommend.",

      "Amit's work went far beyond any expectations I had going in. Our trilangual child has had a significant speech delay, one that we didn't fully understand. Amit saw my child for who he is, strengths and challenges alike, and has been guiding our family on this journey. She makes sure her patients have all the support they need to succeed by giving the parents exact instructions on homework or other specialists who's help we should seek. After 6 months of working together, the progress is no less than amazing. He's so much more engaged with everything around him, because he finally understands. We are so thankful for having her on his team.",

      "Amit was my son's speech therapist for about 3 years and she was the most professional and caring therapist my son had. Amit is very intelligent and has a great knowledge in the speech and language field. She has many years of experience working with a variety of children. With animated and creative personality, she always finds a way to have the children excited and engaged. Amit always thinks about the children, their interests and what would be the best approach to teach each one of them. She really cares. As a parent who had no knowledge about my son's challenges, Amit was there to support and guide. She explained everything she was doing and guided me how to work with my son at home. She always welcome parents to join her sessions and I learned a lot from her. My son loved her.",

      "My family has been working with Amit Alon for what feels to be forever, but has realistically lasted the duration of my child's early childhood years. Ms. Alon has provided comprehensive and thoughtful assessments, generated meaningful treatment goals, and never failed to adapt to my child's response to therapy. But most importantly, Ms. Alon has tended for the most often overlooked aspect of receiving any specialized therapy: the bigger picture. She has worked with my child's grandmother, my husband, and me to create a language rich environment and refine our daily routines so that my child can successfully bring the lessons from speech therapy into his daily life. I am immensely grateful for the support and guidance that Ms. Alon has provided my child and my family at such an important time in my child's life.",
